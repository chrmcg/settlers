IMPLEMENT:

- Move the VideoCanvas onto the app and show the VideoFeed of whoever's 
turn it is (gapi.hangout.layout)
- Align the player_fields in game.statusbox with the Hangouts "filmstrip"
- Add touchscreen support (mouseover not supported, so 
  call game.actions.confirmPlacement or cancelPlacement on touchend)
- Players can only move on their turns
- Only start game once all players are present

BUGS:

- Cannot cancel building road/settlement/city (phase == 2 only)
- Road options do not hide for other players after building a road (only if you proceed after action changes for every player)
- Robber doesn't get placed correctly
