========
Settlers is an open-source clone of the internationally popular board game "The Settlers of Catan" by Klaus Terber. 
It uses the Google+ Hangouts platform to offer in-game webcam chat among players.

If you are on the list of Settlers developers, you can try out the alpha version:
* Sign into Google+ (plus.google.com)
* Start a Hangout with up to 4 people (during the alpha, only Settlers developers can play)
* Choose "Settlers" from the list of apps along the left border of the hangout window

If you aren't on the list, you can check this page for project updates & releases.
